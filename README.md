# Galvanist - Java Edition

This repository contains my mod, *Galvanist: the electrical wonder*. This mod aims to add galvanic batteries, and some more simple "magical" aspects.

## Why Multiple editions?

This is my attempt to learn not just more JVM based languages, but to learn to use Gradle and other build systems.

Other than that, I'd like to see what kind of esoteric languages I can use to create a Minecraft mod.

## Why Java?

Minecraft is written in Java and Forge too. It's easier to ~~re~~learn things, like how forge's system work and such.

As My first attempt, I think It's a good choice to go with.

## What about the other languages?

You can find a branch for every language that I'm currently working on.
